            <h4>Technology</h4>
            <p>Great North Travels will rely on a Computerized Reservation System (CRS) for all client reservations.<br>>
                 The CRS enables travel agencies to identify what the customer is looking for and make that information available quickly.
                 It also increases the speed and efficiency with which GRT organization can communicate with suppliers.
                 In addition, the CRS makes customer data storage and retrieval relatively simple
                . ATI will also make use of the Internet for market research and communications.<br>
                We are looking forward to start platforms on every social media. Customer Reviews and Complaints can be posted in Yelp page
                which we constantly check in order to improve our customer satisfaction aspect.

            <h4>Fulfillment</h4>
            <p>
                Great North Travels has established relationships with providers of travel related products and services.<br>
                 Two major airlines have been selected as our primary ticket providers in part because they do not cap the agent’s profit on tickets.
                 This allows us to capture the 10% margin on ticket sales that was for many years the industry standard.<br>
                 Market research has enabled us to identify and establish working relationships with service providers around the world.
                 Sourcing will be continuously evaluated by GNt employees each and every day.<br>
                 Most of our customers have positive aspects on the service we provide , we have seen a 34% increase in in this year.
                 Most of our customers know about our agency by former customers and travel agency reviewers.

            <h4>Future Services</h4>
            <p>Great North Travels may in the future open agencies at additional locations around Ottawa. <br>
                In addition, as the adventure travel market reaches maturity,
                 GNT may participate in additional segments of the travel market.<br>
                 GNT is researching the market to identify potential opportunities for future sales.<br>
                 GNT’s long-term goal is to establish itself as an internationally recognized provider of top-of-the-line adventure travel.
                 This goal does not prohibit GNT from participating in additional segments.<br>
                 It does, however, provide a corporate focus and a differentiated offering.
                 We are looking forward to attract international customers more by giving discounts and assist with their visa processing.
